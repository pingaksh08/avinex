          <b style="font-size: 24px;">Methodology</b>
          <p>At Avinex, a highly structured development methodology is followed that helps in delivering solutions successfully and providing support to its overseas clients. In summary, project execution at Avinex comprises the following steps:
            <p>1. Analysis and Design</p> 
            <p>2. Development of Prototype</p>
            <p>3. Client Review of Prototype</p>
            <p>4. Development of Production Application</p>
            <p>5. Final Testing and Deployment</p>
            <p>6. Post Deployment Support and Maintenance</p>
            <p>7. A lot of stress is given on building a detailed plan which is of paramount importance for the success of a project. At various stages of development, several documents are created and delivered to the client. Following is a typical list.
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Project Plan</b></li>
            <p>The project plan is used as a very effective document for tracking and maintaining the schedule of project. It lists all the major milestones for project delivery along with other details. The project plan is monitored through out the development process to facilitate early detection and timely correction of slippages.
            </p>
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Functional Design Document</b></li>
            <p>            Describes all the functional details related to the project i.e. objective, scope, functional description, flowcharts & major workflows, validation and security requirements and functional assumptions. All the details are supported with appropriate flowcharts, schematics wherever necessary.
            </p>            
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Technical Design Document</b></li>
             <p>            Describes the technical details i.e. hardware architecture, technology used, project modules etc.
            </p> 
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Database Design Document</b></li>

            <p>Describes the database structure.</p>
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Application and well documented Source Code</b></li>
             <p>            The source code is well documented to facilitate future maintenance and upgrades. Full source code of the project is delivered to the client depending on the project agreement.
             </p>            
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Test Cases Document</b></li>
             <p>            Describes the test cases and test plan used to test the application. This document is very handy for regression testing when changes or upgrades are done.
            </p>
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Special Features/Dependencies Document</b></li>
            <p>            Includes the details of any special tools used in the application. These may include encryption, payment gateways, third party components etc.
            </p>            
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Deployment Document and Installation</b></li>
            <p>            Describes all the details on installation and verification for the applications.
            </p>            
            <li><b style="font-size: 22px;">Online Help/User Manual</b></li>
            
            <p>Depending upon the type of application, a fairly comprehensive online help or user manual is provided.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <b style="font-size: 24px;">Project Cycle</b>
            <p>	
              Projects are executed by a team. A project team consists of a Project Manager, Developers and a Quality Controller. The Project Manager is responsible for handling the day to day activities during the development, monitoring and keeping development on track, creation and updation of reference documents and timely delivery with quality standards.
              
              During the analysis phase, we review the functional requirements and work out detailed engineering requirements. Typically Avinex gets a high level functional requirements document from Astron which we expand into detailed design. The functional design document is supplemented by a technical design document, database design document and any other document required for development.
              
              Depending upon the project a prototype or proof-of-concept is also developed. The documents, along with the prototype is greatly helps Astron and its clients visualizing the final solution and it ability to meet the requirements. Suggestions and modifications are also incorporated into the design and upon the client’s approval a fully functional version is developed.</p>
              <b style="font-size: 24px;">Quality Systems</b>
              <p>Quality Assurance processes followed throughout the project cycle. While the development is progressing, the quality control person in the team starts developing the test cases so that testing can start as soon as parts of the project are developed. The quality controller works as a part of the development team so that he is familiar with all the details and changes that come in during the development. This helps in maximizing the testing coverage.

                Once development is complete, the application undergoes rigorous testing for functionality based on the test cases. Several other tests are performed for security, language, consistency and performance.
                
                Near the completion of development each application undergoes a series of reviews and walkthroughs to ensure high standards of quality. Team members on other projects participate actively in reviews (application as well as code) and walkthroughs to bring in fresh ideas and observations.
                
                All the above processes and tasks are driven and ensured by several checklists which are maintained by the project leader. The checklists ensure that each project meets the same standards of reliability.
                
                Once an application has passed thru the development cycle, the first beta is released to the client. After this, the client feedback is collected and incorporated into the application before releasing the final version upon the client’s approval.
                
                Subsequently, all the documents are updated as a final deliverable.</p>
